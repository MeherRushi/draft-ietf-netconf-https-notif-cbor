1.  Introduction

   CBOR offers an efficient and compact representation of YANG.

   This document introduces a CBOR encoding scheme for event
   notifications over HTTPS by using the framework proposed in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif] which supports transfer of YANG
   notifications over HTTPS using JSON and XML encoding schemes.

   In [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif], the capabilities HTTP-target
   resource allows a publisher to retrieve supported encoding formats
   via GET requests, while the relay-notification resource enables the
   publisher to send YANG notifications via POST requests.  These
   requests and responses use different content types based on the
   selected encoding scheme.  This document defines support for using
   CBOR encoding defined in section 1 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif]

   Examples of the GET and POST request and reply encoded in CBOR are
   also provided.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in Section 2,3 and 4
   of [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif]:

   *  Capabilities Resource

   *  Relay-Notification

   *  Event Notification

   The following term(s) are defined in Subscription to YANG
   Notifications [RFC8639]:

   *  Publisher

   *  Receiver

   *  Subscribed Notifications

   The following term(s) are defined in Encoding of Data Modeled with
   YANG in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC9254]:

   *  Diagnostic Notifications

   *  YANG Schema Item iDentifier (or "YANG SID" or simply "SID"):
      63-bit unsigned integer used to identify different YANG items.

3.  CBOR Encoding of the notification(s)

   YANG notifications can be encoded in CBOR using Names or SIDs in
   keys.  Notifications encoded using names is similar to JSON encoding
   as defined in Section 3.4 and 4.3 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif].  Notification encoded using
   YANG-SIDs replaces the names of the keys of the CBOR encoded message
   with a 63 bit unsigned integer.  In this case, the term 'SID' is
   defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC9254], and the keys of the encoded data
   use SID value as mentioned in 4.3.2 of this document.

3.1.  Capabilities Request

   The publisher sends a request to the receiver to learn its
   capabilities.  In the below example, the “Accept” states that the
   publisher wants to receive the capabilities response in CBOR but if
   not supported then in XML or JSON in that order.

   GET /some/path/capabilities HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/cbor, application/xml;0.5, application/json;q=0.9

3.2.  Capabilities Response

   If the receiver is able to reply using “application/cbor” and
   assuming it is only capable of receiving CBOR encoded messages the
   response would look like this

3.2.1.  CBOR using names as keys

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   If the receiver is able to reply using “application/cbor” and
   assuming it is not capable of receiving cbor, but can receive both
   json and xml notifications:

   If the receiver is unable to reply using "application/cbor", but is
   capable of receiving only cbor then the response might look like
   this:

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Date: Tue, 4 March 2025 20:33:30 GMT

           ]
         }
      }

3.3.  Relay Notification request

   The publisher sends an HTTP POST request to the "relay-notification"
   resource on the receiver with the "Content-Type" header set to
   "application/cbor" in case the receiver is CBOR capable and a body
   containing the notification encoded in CBOR.

3.4.  Relay Notification Response

   The response on success is "204 (No Content)".  In case of corrupted
   or malformed event, the response is an appropriate HTTP error
   response.

3.5.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   specification defined by this document at the time of posting.  The
   information is provided to assist the IETF in evaluating the maturity
   and implementability of the specification.  This section will be
   removed prior to publication as an RFC.

3.6.  Implementation: HTTPS Notification CBOR Draft Implementation

   *  _Organization_: National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK),
      Surathkal

   *  _Implementation Name / Web Page_: HTTPS Notification CBOR Draft
      Implementation https://github.com/MeherRushi/https-notif-draft-
      impl (https://github.com/MeherRushi/https-notif-draft-impl)

   *  _Description_: This implementation provides a Python-based
      prototype of the mechanism defined in this document for
      transporting YANG notifications over HTTPS using JSON, XML and
      CBOR encoding.  It supports name-based CBOR encoding and includes
      basic publisher and receiver roles to demonstrate end-to-end
      message exchange.

   *  _Maturity Level_: Prototype

   *  _Coverage_:

      -  Capabilities discovery via HTTP GET to /capabilities

      -  Event publication via HTTP POST to /relay-notification

      -  Support for name-based CBOR encoding as described in this
         document

   *  _Version Compatibility_: The implementation is based on draft-
      ietf-netconf-https-notif-15 and draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif-
      cbor-00.

   *  _Licensing_: Freely distributable under an MIT-style license.

   *  _Implementation Experience_:

      -  Developed and demonstrated at IETF 121 and 122 Hackathon.

      -  Worked toward enabling CBOR encoding in the libyang library as
         part of the hackathon effort (slides
         (https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/123/materials/slides-123-
         hackathon-sessd-adding-cbor-support-in-libyang-00)).

      -  Evaluated CBOR efficiency compared to JSON and XML in
         constrained environments.

      -  Built tooling to simulate and measure notification transfer
         behavior over varying network conditions.

      -  Diagnostic encoding examples used for validation of CBOR
         structures.

4.  Security Considerations

   Addition of the CBOR encoding introduces no specific security
   exposures or risks other that the ones mentioned in [RFC9254] and
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif] (An HTTPS-based Transport for
   YANG Notifications)

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA include an additional entry in the
   “Capabilities for HTTPS Notification Receivers” registry, defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif].  The following entry is added:

Record:
   URN:         urn:ietf:params:yang-notif:https-capability:encoding:cbor
   Reference:   RFC XXXX:An HTTPS-based Transport for YANG Notifications
   Description: Identifies support for CBOR-encoded notifications.
